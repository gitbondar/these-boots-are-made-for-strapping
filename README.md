# These Boots Are Made For Strapping

### Introduction

Today we'll be building our first little project with Bootstrap's Grid System: a photo album of... boots? Or whatever you want. But the boots are included if you want them.


### Quick Start

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. The bootstrap grid css file is already downloaded. But you'll have to make an index.html file and `link` it! If you want to grab some Bootstrap components, you'll have to download those as well. For this project, no network links, please. Only local css files!
3. Use either the boots provided or download 24 images of another theme.

### Goals

Pay careful attention to the specs here!

* For the "extra large" viewport, there should be 4 rows.
  * The first and last rows should have 8 images. (Not that they don't have to be the same width!)
  * The middle rows should have 4 images each, with the first image in each row taking up half the space.

* For the medium viewport, there should be 7 rows.
  * The odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, and 7) should have 3 images each, with the first 2 taking up a quarter of the width each and the last taking up half.
  * The even-numbred rows (2, 4, and 6) should have 4 images each, with the images of even size.

* For the extra small viewport, there should be 24 rows of one photo each.


### Guidelines

* You do NOT have to do these viewport sizes in order! I would recommend the extra large and extra small sizes first.


### Stretch Goals

In any order!:
* Add different photos! These Boots Are Made For Breaking In And Making Yours.
* Add a small viewport with two columns.
* For the large viewport size, use the same layout as the extra large, but reverse the columns. Make this also take effect for the extra large viewport.
* Now have it be large viewport ONLY.
* Reverse the order of the last eight rows for the extra small viewport.
